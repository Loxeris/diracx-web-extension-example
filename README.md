# Creating a Next.js DiracX Web Extension

This project aims to provide an example for creating a basic Next.js web extension for DiracX. It includes the necessary configuration and setup to get you started quickly.

This README will guide you through the process of creating a Next.js DiracX Web extension.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- docker

## Getting Started

You can either create a new repository or fork this repository to get started with your extension.

1. Fork the repository on GitHub and clone it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-extension.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-extension
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start your DiracX extension with DiraX Charts:

   ```bash
   # In a parent directory
   # Clone the diracx-chart repository
   git clone git@github.com:DIRACGrid/diracx-charts.git

   # Run the demo script
   ./diracx-charts/run_demo.sh path/to/your-extension
   ```

### Customizing the Extension

To customize the extension, you can modify the files in the `src` directory. This is where you'll find the main components and logic of your extension.

Feel free to explore the code and make changes according to your requirements.
